# CheaPlay Bot
Discord bot that compares prices of a given game name in common buying webs.

It implements a demo to test the scrapper and a Python API for no bot usage in other apps, the discord bot is dockerizable and a Dockerfile is provided that automates the whole image creation and configuration.

As for now, the search parameters are:
- Plataform: Steam
- Currency: Euro â‚¬
- Region: Global or Europe

If requested, I might add options to change that parameters.
